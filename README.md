===================

Cadair's Nikola theme

This theme is used on http://www.stuartmumford.co.uk. It is still in beta, and
needs a little work. It is based around a simple homepage with a pretty picture
in a bootstrap3 jumbotron. It also includes the IPython css so it should work
ok with IPython notebooks.

This theme has now been merged into the 
[nikola themes](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola-themes/tree/master/v7/cadair)
repository.
